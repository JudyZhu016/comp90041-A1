For this project, we will be implementing the game PACMAN on a console(terminal).
This program will be built in two parts (Pacman_1 and Pacman_a2), with Pacman_1 building the groundwork for the final system in Pacman_a2.  
In Pacman_1, we will build an initial system implementation based on what we've learned about object-oriented programming so far. In Pacman_a2, we will extend the system with additional features, and also refactor existing features with newly learned Object Oriented Programming concepts, to make our code more elegant.
